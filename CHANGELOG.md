### Agent Evolution Path
The project includes three reference implementations showing the evolution from simple to advanced:

1. **Agent v0** (`agent-v0.ps1`): Simple single-command agent using OpenAI
2. **Agent v1** (`agent-v1.ps1`): Looping agent with JSON-based responses using OpenAI
3. **Agent v2** (`agent-v2.ps1`): Advanced agent with structured tools and function calling using OpenAI

### Migration to Anthropic
- **API Migration**: Transitioned from OpenAI to Anthropic Claude API for improved performance and capabilities
- **Model Updates**: Updated to use latest Claude models (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
